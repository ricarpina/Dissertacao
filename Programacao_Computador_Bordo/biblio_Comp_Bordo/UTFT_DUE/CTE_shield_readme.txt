The library is created to add the ability to draw bigger and nicer fonts and some commonly used icons to the LCD screen for users to develop their arduino applications easily, this function requires the LCD module/shield to have a Font IC.

The library is also modified for hardware modifications of LCD data and command lines at hardware level
